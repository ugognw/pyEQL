# Arithmetic Operations

## Addition and Subtraction

You can use the `+` operator to mix (combine) two solutions. The moles of each component
in the two solutions will be added together, and the volume of the mixed solution will
be _approximately_ equal to the sum of the two volumes, depending on the electrolyte
modeling engine used. The pressure and temperature of the mixed solution are computed
as volume-weighted averages.

```{eval-rst}
.. doctest::

   >>> from pyEQL import Solution
   >>> s1 = Solution({"Na+": "0.5 mol/L", "Cl-": "0.5 mol/L"})
   >>> s2 = Solution({"Na+": "0.1 mol/L", "Cl-": "0.1 mol/L"})
   >>> s1+s2
   <pyEQL.solution.Solution object at 0x7f171aee3af0>
   >>> (s1+s2).get_amount('Na+', 'mol')
   <Quantity(0.6, 'mole')>
   >>> (s1+s2).volume
   <Quantity(1.99989659, 'liter')>

```

```{note}
Both `Solution` involved in an addition operation must use the same [electrolyte
modeling engine](engines.md).
```

Subtraction is not implemented and will raise a `NotImplementedError`.

```{eval-rst}
.. doctest::

   >>> s1-s2
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
     File "/home/ryan/mambaforge/envs/pbx/code/pyEQL/src/pyEQL/solution.py", line 2481, in __sub__
       raise NotImplementedError("Subtraction of solutions is not implemented.")
   NotImplementedError: Subtraction of solutions is not implemented.

```

## Multiplication and Division

The `*` and `/` operators scale the volume and all component amounts by a factor.

```{eval-rst}
.. doctest::

   from pyEQL import Solution
   >>> s = Solution({"Na+": "0.2 mol/L", "Cl-": "0.2 mol/L"})
   >>> s.volume
   <Quantity(1, 'liter')>
   >>> s.get_amount('Cl-', 'mol')
   <Quantity(0.2, 'mole')>
   >>> s*=1.5
   <Quantity(1.5, 'liter')>
   s.get_amount('Cl-', 'mol')
   <Quantity(0.3, 'mole')>

```

The modulo operator `//` is not implemented.
